The lab has both SQL database implmented localy and uses the Azure Cosmos DB Emulator for MongoDB for the NoSQL part.
The reports are shown in the Default.aspx when starting the application i fthe user scrolls down.
The first 6 tables are from the SQL database while the last two are from the NoSQL MongoDB database.
The report are printed when the page loads the SQL part inthe Default.aspx code while the NoSQL report is called in the page load.
The code works like lab2 except that the car part is hidden since we dont need to use that part for this lab.
The user enters the data for desired booking and it will be saved into the database.
For the SQL database I use a connectionString and use the necessary SQL command in order to input the data that the user entered.
For the NoSQL database I have objects of Transaction and Customer these gets saved into the MongoDB database in the Mongo class.
Comments exist through out the code to explain the usage of the parts.
